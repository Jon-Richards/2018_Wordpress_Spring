# March (Unnamed Wordpress Theme)

## Build Process

PHP and general markup files are located in the *export* directory.  When the build process is run, the "export" directory is copied to Wordpress's themes directory so that it can be previewed.  The export destination can be changed in `/npm_scripts/project_config.js`.
